# Food Access

## Objective
In this project, I worked with a real-world dataset from CORGIS, which stands for The Collection of Really Great, Interesting, Situated Datasets. The dataset was slightly modified and contained information about access to stores that sell food, such as grocery stores, broken down by county. This data was useful for identifying communities with significant "food deserts," but it also included additional relevant details like population, vehicle access, income levels, and more. For this lab, my focus was on searching for records by county name, state, and population. In a more practical application, I could have used this data to cross-reference information and search for or display specific patterns or relationships within the data.
